# MERJURE™

MERJURE™ is an explainable acquisition screening engine designed to help corporate development and investment teams identify, rank, and justify M&A targets with speed and transparency.

## Why MERJURE exists

Traditional M&A screening is manual, spreadsheet-heavy, and opaque.  
MERJURE transforms raw market data into a structured, weighted, and explainable acquisition shortlist — reducing bias, increasing clarity, and accelerating decision-making.

## Scoring Architecture

Each target receives a composite score based on configurable weighted inputs:

- Strategic Fit (adjacency, overlap, expansion logic)
- Growth & Quality (revenue growth, margin profile)
- Financial Risk (leverage penalties)
- Margin Uplift Potential
- Synergy Proxies

Weights are user-controlled (sum = 100), allowing dynamic re-ranking depending on acquisition strategy.

## Decision Outputs

- Radar profile per target
- Ranked shortlists
- Top 10 explainable outputs
- Exportable PDF & PPTX investment packs
